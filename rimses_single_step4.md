# Installing addons

## Add-on 1: Integration with Microsoft Project

### Step 1: Verify version of Microsoft Project

Check the Microsoft Project version on the machine (see document Rimses software requirements - Integration with Microsoft Office). Install the required version on the system if necessary.

### Step 2: Information of the standard integration templates

There are two ways to make the MS-Project integration templates available for Rimses:

The templates are copied in '[Rimses Installfolder]\MSProject'.
The user for the MS-Project link must have reading and writing rights on this folder. Should this be a problem, then the location of these templates can be customized by modifying the Rimses general configuration number 344 and copy the templates there.

## Add-on 2: Integration with barcode scanner

Barcode scanners who communicate with Rimses through the machines COM port (e.g. MC3000 and MC3100)

This feature is only available for the application Rimses. For configuration and setup of the scanner, we refer to the standard online help in Rimses. A barcode scanner is delivered ready to use and in administrative mode. This admin mode is necessary to have access to multiple menu items.

When admin mode is not active, only the menu item '1 DELIV/CORR' is available. Admin mode can be deactivated by de-selecting 'Admin mode' in the option parameters. To reactivate admin mode so that the multiple menus are available again, you can execute the following steps:

Press the 'ESC' button to return to the language menu. The choices '1 NEDERLANDS', '2 FRANï¿½AIS' and '3 ENGLISH' are visible.
Use the 'ALPHA' button to switch to alphabetic mode.
Press 'CTRL'-'E'.
The welcome window displays, press 'ENTER'
In the language menu, select a language.
All menu items are visible again. Activate the parameters menu and switch on admin mode, to keep the admin mode active.
